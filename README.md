# Student Performance Classification System With Decision Tree Algorithm

Abstract

The analysis and evaluation of students’ performance and retaining the standard of education is a very important problem in all the educations situations.
The most important goal of this project is to analyze and evaluate the school students’ performance by applying data mining classification with decision tree algorithm.
In this system, data set is considered in prediction of the performance of students.
Can predict the average of students who passed or failed depend on reading score, writing score and math score.
Can also analyze read pass, write pass and math pass with all the students of “parental level of education” and “test preparation course”.
Build decision tree classification with python.
